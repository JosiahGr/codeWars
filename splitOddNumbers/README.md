Mario and Josiah whiteboarded for the solution (even though the actual solution was WAY more complicated then we realized).

PROBLEM DOMAIN:

Write a function insertDash(num)/InsertDash(int num) that will insert dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers in num. For example: if num is 454793 the output should be 4547-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd number.
